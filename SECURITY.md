## Report a security issue

The compute-starter-kit-static-content project team welcomes security reports and is committed to providing prompt attention to security issues. Security issues should be reported privately via [Fastlyâ€™s security issue reporting process](https://www.fastly.com/security/report-security-issue).

## Security advisories

Remediation of security vulnerabilities is prioritized by the project team. The project team endeavors to coordinate remediation with third-party stakeholders, and is committed to transparency in the disclosure process. The team announces security issues via $RELEASE-ANNOUNCEMENT-E.G.-GITHUB-RELEASE as well as $ECOSYSTEM-SPECIFIC-ADVISORY-DATABASE-EG-RUSTSEC on a best-effort basis.

Note that communications related to security issues in Fastly-maintained OSS as described here are distinct from [Fastly Security Advisories](https://www.fastly.com/security-advisories).
